ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my space =)

 ðŸ‘€ My name is Gabriel and I currently work as a Business Inteligence Developer and Data Analyst.

During my professional experiece I've been involved in many activities involing Data: extracting, transforming, combining, analyzing and creating various types of reports.

Here I can publish part of my work in all of this.

I've made a [Portfolio with some Power BI dashboards](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWQzZGU0NzktMDU5Zi00NGU2LTg4NTEtNDRiOGY5ZGY1N2QzIiwidCI6IjQ2N2U1YWM1LWQ4OTYtNDc4Ni05YTYyLWViZjdjMGFmYTMyOCJ9) I developed.

Altough I was not able to document it, I also have solid experience using Tableau.  
I'm starting to create dashboards using Python as well, and putting some of the work in this repository:

There are repositories for SQL queries and for Data Analysis.

There's also a [litte space I created on Medium to share some texts about my work, the Data market at all and more](https://medium.com/@gm.costa94)
